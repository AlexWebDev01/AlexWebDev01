I am a versatile QA Automation Engineer with a strong background in web development. With strong experience testing web and mobile-based applications, I have worked in full-stack teams following Agile and Scrum best practices, using Jira software for efficient project management.
<br><br>
My systematic and methodical approach to testing is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and QA methodologies. I excel in performing a wide range of testing types, including Functional, Smoke, Regression, API, and Back-end testing. This ensures the delivery of high-quality software products by covering all critical aspects of the application.
<br><br>
I have developed meticulous test plans, test strategies, test cases, test data, and test checklists to ensure thorough test coverage. Utilizing modern JavaScript-based tools such as Playwright and Puppeteer, I have successfully implemented test automation, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the testing process.
<br><br>
In addition to my technical skills, my background as an actor has honed my communication and public performance abilities. These skills have been instrumental in collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams, presenting test findings and reports, and fostering a positive and dynamic work environment.
