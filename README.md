I'm a Front-end Developer with a focus on creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I utilize advanced technologies such as Semantic HTML, Flex layouts, and SEO best practices to design and develop responsive websites and applications.
<br><br>
Passionate about utilizing efficient tools and libraries, I have experience working with SASS and React. I have also collaborated in Agile teams, utilizing team management tools such as Jira Software, Kanban boards, and Sprints.
<br><br>
In addition to my technical skills, I bring a unique perspective to my work as a former actor, with strong communication and public performance skills honed through my education and training. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my expertise and provide valuable contributions to my team.
